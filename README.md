# Zelda II Rewrite

## Building and Running

You'll need 
- Nim compiler (I used 0.17.2)
- sdl2_nim installed (via `nimble install sdl2_nim`)
- The original Zelda II ROM, I used the english version, I haven't tested with the japanese version (yet).

## What's a nasc?

Nasc is irish for link (the protagonist of the Zelda series). I wanted the engine name to reflect the game, since this engine most likely won't be useful outside of this scenario.
